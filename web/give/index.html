        <b>How many kids have to grow up without parents before we reform our prison system?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mass incarceration is costly, ineffective, and often inhumane. Most Americans agree that our current system isn’t working for our country or our children. In fact, 2.7 million children have a parent in jail or prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why the Vera Institute of Justice is dedicated to reducing the use of jail and focusing on rehabilitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vera is a pioneer in identifying why mass incarceration persists in our society. Now, we need like-minded individuals to <a href="#donation-form" class="scrollto-form">join our fight</a> to cut the use of incarceration, transform life behind bars, and help people successfully return to their families and communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>As a country that leads the world in locking up its own people, we need programs to shift the focus of incarceration to rehabilitation and affirm human dignity.</b>

            <div class="swiper-copy">
              <p>
                Partnering with states and cities like New Jersey, New York City, Nebraska, and Oregon, we have helped some jurisdictions to safely decrease the number of people held in solitary by more than 50% over the last two years. Other sites have eliminated solitary for incarcerated young people and reduced the maximum time allowed in solitary.

                We helped the Asheville, North Carolina, police department work with community representatives to revise their use of force and de-escalation policies, setting an example that can be adopted by other communities.
