    content="Every region of Louisiana is harmed by mass incarceration: nearly every parish has a pretrial incarceration rate above the national average, and dozens of parishes send people to prison at a rate above the national average.

But parish and state-level research by the Vera Institute of Justice aims to clarify this picture." />
